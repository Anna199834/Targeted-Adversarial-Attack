# Targeted-Adversarial-Attack

## Method
We noticed that targeted attacks have little transferability. So we instead only focus on white-box targeted attack. We also use the iterative fast gradient sign approach with momentum. We ensemble five models in our code.

## Models
The models can be downloaded [here](http://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~yinpeng/nips17/targeted/models.zip).
